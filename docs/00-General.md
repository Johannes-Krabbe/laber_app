# General
Laber is an chat app that I (Johannes Krabbe) created int the scope of my final "Capstone Project" at the CODE university of applied sciences in Berlin.

The goal of this project was it to create a usable chat app, similar to Signal or WhatsApp. This document will give you an overview of the technical documentation including the software architecture decisions I made when creating this project.
